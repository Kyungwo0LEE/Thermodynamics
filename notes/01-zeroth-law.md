# Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

## Overview
The zeroth law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of temperature and thermal equilibrium.

## Statement
If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

## Key Implications
- Defines the concept of temperature
- Allows the use of thermometers
- Fundamental for thermal measurements

## Notes
(Will be expanded with examples and diagrams.)
